# 100-days-of-code-in-python
##### Udemy Angela Yu's course that has 100 projects for students to make each day with classes of 1-2 hours duration.<br>
###### This repository will store all the related projects. If you are interested in any code files, please run the code in an IDE for Python, though I recommend running it on Replit as some modules are imported based on the website.<hr>

###### Below is my summary of what I've learned every day and the link to fork the project on Repl.it (Online IDE):

### Day 1 - [Band Name Generator](https://repl.it/@LeeRen1/D1-Band-name-generatorPOTD):

- Created an encryption/decryption program using a Caesar cipher.
- Applied functions, loops, and learned about modulo `%` for shifting letters.
- Worked with positional and keyword arguments in functions.

### Day 9 - [Blind Auction](https://repl.it/@LeeRen1/D9-blind-auction-startPOTD#main.py):
- Created a blind auction program where the highest bid wins.
- Learned about dictionaries, nesting dictionaries, and looping through them.
- Worked with `while` and `for` loops.

### Day 10 - [Calculator](https://repl.it/@LeeRen1/D10-calculatorPOTD):
- Built a calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations and loop for further calculations.
- Learned about recursion (calling a function inside itself) and flagging with loops.
- Used `print` and `return` functions and understood their differences.

### Day 11 - [Blackjack Game](https://repl.it/@LeeRen1/D11-blackjackPOTD):
- Built a Blackjack game where the player tries to get a sum of cards closest to 21.
- Used docstrings for function descriptions.
- Applied recursion and flagging techniques.
- Worked with the `sum()` function and `list.remove()`.

### Day 12 - [Number Guessing Game](https://repl.it/@LeeRen1/D12-Number-Guessing-GamePOTD#main.py):
- Built a number guessing game with easy/hard modes.
- Learned about constants and variable scopes (local and global).
- Applied flagging and recursion concepts.

### Day 13 - [Debugging Techniques](https://repl.it/@LeeRen1/D13-start#main.py):
- Learned 10 debugging techniques, including:
  - Reproducing bugs.
  - Using print statements and debuggers.
  - Asking for help and searching StackOverflow.

### Day 14 - [Higher-Lower Game](https://repl.it/@LeeRen1/Day14-higher-lower-gamePOTD#main.py):
- Built a higher-lower game where users guess which celebrity has more followers.
- Reviewed dictionaries and functions.
- Learned how to randomly assign values for each loop.

### Day 15 - [Coffee Machine](https://repl.it/@LeeRen1/D15-coffee-machine-finalPOTD):
- Continued the coffee machine project.
