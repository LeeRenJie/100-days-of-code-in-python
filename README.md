# 100-days-of-code-in-python
Udemy Angela Yu's course that has 100 projects for students to make each day with classes with duration of 1~2 hours each day.<br>
This repository will store all the related projects. If you are intrested in any code files, please run the code in an IDE for python.<hr>

Below is my summary of what I've learned everyday and the link to fork the project in Repl.it(Online IDE):

<b>Day 1</b> (https://repl.it/@LeeRen1/D1-Band-name-generatorPOTD):<br>
A band name generator from the input of users of their country and a random pet name.
1. Used the print function, input function , and creating a variable.
2. Learned about commenting
3. Learned that "\n" brings the cursor/content to the next line in the same print function

<b>Day 2</b> (https://repl.it/@LeeRen1/D24-Tip-calculator-startPOTD):<br>
Created a simple calculator that takes in input of the total bill, percentage of tips to be given and the amount of people to split the bill. 
1. Applied the f string(found it really convenient)
2. Reminded me that inputs are in string data type and has to be converted into float/integers before dong any calculations
3. Reminded me how to round off with a specified decimal number "rounding_off=Round(2.666666,2)" = 2.66

<b>Day 3</b> (https://repl.it/@LeeRen1/D36-Treasure-islandPOTD):<br>
Created a storytelling like treasure island adventure where each steps u take lead to different outcomes.
1. Applied ASCII Art (figures made by numbers and symbols) via: https://ascii.co.uk/art
2. Learned if/elif/else statements & nested if/elif/else & multiple ifs
3. Reminded me that indentation is important in python
