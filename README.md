# 100-days-of-code-in-python
Udemy Angela Yu's course that has 100 projects for students to make each day with classes with duration of 1~2 hours each day.<br>
This repository will store all the related projects. If you are intrested in any code files, please run the code in an IDE for python.<hr>

Below is my summary of what I've learned everyday and the link to fork the project in Repl.it(Online IDE):

<b>Day 1</b> (https://repl.it/@LeeRen1/D1-Band-name-generatorPOTD):<br>
A band name generator from the input of users of their country and a random pet name.
1. Used the print function, input function , and creating a variable.
2. Learned about commenting
3. Learned that "\n" brings the cursor/content to the next line in the same print function

<b>Day 2</b> (https://repl.it/@LeeRen1/D24-Tip-calculator-startPOTD):<br>
Created a simple calculator that takes in input of the total bill, percentage of tips to be given and the amount of people to split the bill. 
1. Applied the f string(found it really convenient)
2. Reminded me that inputs are in string data type and has to be converted into float/integers before dong any calculations
3. Reminded me how to round off with a specified decimal number "rounding_off=Round(2.666666,2)" = 2.66

<b>Day 3</b> (https://repl.it/@LeeRen1/D36-Treasure-islandPOTD):<br>
Created a storytelling like treasure island adventure where each steps u take lead to different outcomes.
1. Applied ASCII Art (figures made by numbers and symbols) via: https://ascii.co.uk/art
2. Learned if/elif/else statements & nested if/elif/else & multiple ifs
3. Reminded me that indentation is important in python
4. Had fun! ðŸ˜†

<b>Day 4</b> (https://repl.it/@LeeRen1/D44-rock-paper-scissors-POTD):<br>
Created a simple rock-paper-scissors gameðŸ‘ŠðŸ¤šâœŒ where the computer's move is randomly generated using the random.choice after putting all moves into a list and selecting randomly.
1. Overall,learned about lists and how flexible it is whether it is to extend the list, replacing the item, choose a specific item with index starting from 0 from front and -1 from back, extending the list with another list from input and more
2. Learned that nested list and list_name[1][1] means choosing the second nested list in the general list and then choosing the second item from the selected list.
3. Revised if/elif/else statements and nested ifs
4. Learned about the python random module and differentiating between random.randint(starting index,ending index)/random.float()/random.choice(list_name)
5. Aware of index error and in most situation the index has to -1 since the computer starts counting from 0

<b>Day 5</b> (https://repl.it/@LeeRen1/D55-Password-generatorPOTD#main.py):<br>
Created a password generator that takes the user input for number of lettters/symbols/numbers wanted in the password then generated two types of password, first is following the sequence where it goes from letters to numbers and the second harder password is to shuffle the sequence od the password so that there is no specific pattern to ensure maximum security.ðŸ”’
1. Learned the fundamentals of for loops and for loop with a range[for x in range(start, end, step/gap)] 
2. Learned that I cant shuffle strings with the random.shuffle but i can shuffle a list!
3. Learned how to convert a list into a string (line 46-49)
4. Learned the logic behind for loops and it took my some time to finally understand the concept.ðŸ˜µ Definitely need more practice with the algorithm and structure
